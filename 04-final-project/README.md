A pair work with Sze Ching.


For this project, Sze Ching and I created a satirical webpage called “Rage-Bait University Course Selection”, it was inspired by the real frustrations students face with our institution’s confusing and unreliable timetable system. We wanted to exaggerate those annoyances into a chaotic, rage-inducing experience that still feels familiar to students who’ve dealt with broken login pages and unexpected errors. To make it more annoying we added captchas to it. 

Our webpage evolved from a simple parody login screen into a fully interactive multi-screen experience built with p5.js. As we developed it, we kept finding new ways to make it more humorously irritating — from a looping Rickroll video that multiplies when you try to close it, to intentionally frustrating captchas that test your patience more than your humanity. We also added sound effects and visual elements to heighten the absurdity and immersion.

Throughout the process, I learned a lot about state management in p5.js, event handling, and integrating media like audio and video elements within an interactive sketch. More importantly, I realized how interface design can evoke emotion even annoyance through deliberate choices in timing, feedback, and usability. While our goal was to make users laugh, the project also deepened my appreciation for how web design directly affects user experience and emotion, whether intentionally or not.
